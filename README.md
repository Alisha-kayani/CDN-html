Implementing CDN functionality for a simple HTML file involves **serving the HTML file from your FastAPI app while ensuring that its static assets (like CSS and JS) are loaded from a CDN URL**. This is a common practice for web applications to reduce latency and improve load times.

Here is a step-by-step guide to doing this with FastAPI.

### Step 1: Set up Your Project
    uv init myapp
    cd myapp
    uv add fastapi
    uv add uvicorn
    uv add fastapi-cdn-host


1.  Create a folder for your project and a subfolder named `templates`.
2.  Inside the `templates` folder, create your HTML file, for example, `index.html`.
3.  Add a `static` folder to the root of your project. This will temporarily hold your assets before they are uploaded to a CDN.
    ```
    .
    ├── main.py
    └── templates/
    │   └── index.html
    └── static/
        └── style.css
    ```
4.  Write some simple CSS in `static/style.css`.
    ```css
    body {
        font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
        background-color: #f0f0f0;
        text-align: center;
        margin-top: 50px;
    }
    h1 {
        color: #333;
    }
    ```

### Step 2: Create the HTML File

The key to this step is to **use a full CDN URL** for your CSS file, not a local path. This is a crucial step that you need to do manually. In a real-world scenario, you would upload your `style.css` file to your CDN provider's dashboard and get a unique URL.

For this example, we'll use a placeholder URL.

**`templates/index.html`**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>CDN Example</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css">
    
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://your-cdn-domain.com/static/style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <div class="container">
        <h1>FastAPI and CDN</h1>
        <p>This page's CSS is loaded from a Content Delivery Network.</p>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

### Step 3: Serve the HTML with FastAPI

Now, write the FastAPI code to serve the `index.html` file. We'll use `Jinja2Templates` to render the HTML. You'll need to install it first.

```bash
uv pip install jinja2
```

**`main.py`**

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
from fastapi.templating import Jinja2Templates

app = FastAPI()

# Configure the templates directory
templates = Jinja2Templates(directory="templates")

@app.get("/", tags=["Home"])
async def serve_html(request: Request):
    # Renders the index.html file
    return templates.TemplateResponse("index.html", {"request": request})

# The rest of your app's code for running the server would go here
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000, reload=True)
```

### How to Run and Test

1.  Make sure you have all the files and folders set up as described in Step 1.
2.  Open your terminal and run the application.
    ```bash
    uv run uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
3.  Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

The FastAPI app will serve the `index.html` file. When your browser loads the page, it will automatically fetch the CSS from the CDN URLs. The key takeaway is that **your FastAPI application only serves the HTML file**, and the browser handles the task of requesting the CSS and JS files directly from the CDN. .
